# Project Vimaan ✈️  
**AI Co-Pilot for X-Plane**  

Project Vimaan is an experimental AI-powered first officer for the **X-Plane flight simulator**.  
It listens to your **voice commands**, parses them into structured actions (like gear up, flaps down, autopilot settings), and executes them inside the simulator.  

The long-term vision is to build a **fully offline, trainable AI co-pilot** that can assist in flight operations without depending on external LLM providers.

## 🚀 Features (Work in Progress)
- 🎤 **Voice Recognition** → Convert spoken commands into text.  
- 🤖 **Intent Parsing** → Understand pilot intent (gear, flaps, autopilot, etc.).  
- 🛫 **X-Plane Integration** → Execute actions directly in the simulator.  
- 🔌 **Plugin Support** → Deployable as a packaged X-Plane plugin.
